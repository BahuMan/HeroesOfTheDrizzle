Questions
===================
1. Paladin animations downloaded "with skin" -> double meshes?
      => yes. redownload.
2. Hero Abilities: how to make them replaceable (variables in Unity Inspector).
      => NOT. make gameobjects
3. where to focus next?
      => debug existing and add fluff (particle effects, attack anim)

  old hero beta: has 2 healing abilities with particle effects (movement animations need work)
  GUI health bar shows hero's current health
  GUI buttons activate all 3 abilities (todo: show active/inactive + timer, fix bug where left-click also forces attack status)
  stub gamecontroller couples GUI with first hero in list (todo: allow choice of hero)
  red and blue bases spawn minions, minions attack each other and then resume walk to waypoints
  turret (current model: statue of a hooded & robed figure on a socket) is neutral and attacks blue AND red
  TODO: clipping for minions (they should bump into each other)
  DONE: offer hero level-up choice in GUI
